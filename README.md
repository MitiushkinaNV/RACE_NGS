# RACE_NGS
This collection of python scripts was developed to help in the design of the targeted RNA panels on the basis of anhored multiplex PCR-based methods (primarily, 3' and 5' rapid anplification of cDNA ends or RACE), and for the following analysis of the obtained data. While the analysis of rearrangements can effectively be done with the available software (e.g., the STAR-fusion https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion), analysis of somatic mutations and gene expression can be more challenging in such datasets.
